Customer Segmentation SQL Project

I analyzed bank customer data to solve three key business questions:

WHAT I BUILT:
- Customer value scoring system (High/Medium/Low segments)
- Investment behavior analysis across age groups
- Churn risk identification model

KEY FINDINGS:
- Only 46 out of 6,335 customers (0.73%) are High Value
- Senior customers invest more in mutual funds than young customers
- 396 customers (6.25%) are at high risk of leaving

BUSINESS IMPACT:
This analysis helps target marketing, develop better products, and improve customer retention.
